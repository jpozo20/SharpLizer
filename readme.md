# SharpLizer
Short for "C# Colorizer" is a Visual Studio extension for customizing the colors of the code in Visual Studio. 

## Raison d'être
"There are a number of existing extensions that already do that", you may say. 
And that's true, I myself have used some of them. But I wanted to have a finer control over the color so I decided to create my own. 
Besides I wanted to learn more about Roslyn and the internals of Visual Studio.
