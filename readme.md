# SharpLizer
Short for "C# Colorizer" is a Visual Studio extension for customizing the colors of keywords and modifiers in Visual Studio. 

## Raison d'être
"There are a number of existing extensions that already do that", you may say. 
And that's true, I myself have used some of them. But I wanted to have a finer control over the color so I decided to create my own. 
Besides I wanted to learn more about Roslyn and the internals of Visual Studio.

## Using the extension
Once you install the extension there will be no color set. You have to set them yourself. 

To do this you go to **Tools** -> **Options** -> **Fonts and Colors** and look for SharpLizer.
